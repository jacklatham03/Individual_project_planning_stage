    "## Methods and Plan\n",
    "I used KNN classification to predict player experience level based on their age and total hours played. I used KNN because it assigns class labels based on the majority amount the k closest data points near the predicted space. This was appropriate because the data was not linear, and KNN was able to provide a simple/interpretive model. An assumption/limitation made was that the distance between points reflects similarity after being scaled."
